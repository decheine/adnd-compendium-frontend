## Summary

What is Advanced Dungeons & Dragons:  Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd Edition is a table top roleplaying game published by TSR inc. 


### Motivation

    My friends and I played 2nd edition religiously in high school. I stumbled across a site called lomion.de where someone had created a complete appendix of all ad&d 2nd edition monsters. *All* of them. We love to use it and explore the vast collection, but the site was quite archaic and barebones in terms of functionality. Unfortunately, the site went down around 2014. However, it was indexed many times by the Wayback machine. So I sought to resurrect the site and bring the complete monstrous compendium of 2nd Edition D&D to life with lots of navigational and explorational features. 


### Purpose



## Architecture

Describe how the data has been collected, and how it makes it's way to the screen.

Need to have:
- Description of the Project
    - Describe AD&D to someone who doesn't know what it is.
    - What it contains: X settings, Y books, Z monster pages, 
- Purpose
    - No proper public service like this exists. I've found a few, but they were very incomplete with terrible UI. 
    - Historical importance. AD&D was a beloved (and/or frustrating) experience for thousands, with cherished times of the past. 
    - The scope of AD&D content dwarfs all other editions of Dungeons & Dragons. All these monsters serve well as inspriation and starting points, valuable to Game Masters of all fantasy table top roleplaying games. 
- Motivation
    - The original site went offline years ago, and I was capable of resurrecting the platform myself.
    - Another key personal motivation is the technology aspect - I've expanded my knowledge so much building this full stack application, and I've been itching to deploy applications and learn some DevOps. This is the perfect opportunity. 

- Changelog
    - Expanding list of versions, features for each.
