# About

This is for the About Page. Typing the content I want.

Need to have:
- Description of the Project
    - Describe AD&D to someone who doesn't know what it is.
    - What it contains: X settings, Y books, Z monster pages, 
- Purpose
    - No proper public service like this exists. I've found a few, but they were very incomplete with terrible UI. 
    - Historical importance. AD&D was a beloved (or frustrating) experience for thousands, with cherished times of the past. 
    - The scope of AD&D content dwarfs all other editions of Dungeons & Dragons. All these monsters serve well as inspriation and starting points, valuable to Game Masters of all fantasy table top roleplaying games. 
- Motivation
    - The original site went offline years ago, and I was capable of resurrecting the platform myself.
    - Another key personal motivation is the technology aspect - I've expanded my knowledge so much building this full stack application, and I've been itching to deploy applications and learn some DevOps. This is the perfect opportunity. 

- Changelog
    - Expanding list of versions, features for each.
